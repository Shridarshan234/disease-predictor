# Disease Predictor

**Project:** Web-Based Disease Prediction System (Final Year Major Project)  
**Developed By:** Shridarshan Mishra + 2 Team Members  
**Status:** Backend Completed (main branch)

---

## Overview

Disease Predictor is a full-stack application that analyzes user-selected symptoms and returns the most likely disease using machine learning. After experimenting with various ML approaches, Logistic Regression produced the highest accuracy for our dataset, making it the preferred model for this project.

This system is intended to give users an initial understanding of potential health issues based on their symptoms.

**Note:** The predictions generated by this application are for informational purposes only and should not be considered a professional medical diagnosis or treatment.

**Backend:** Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL  
**Machine Learning:** scikit-learn (Logistic Regression), model files (`model.pkl`, `columns.pkl`, `label_encoder.pkl`)  
**Frontend:** React.js (details below)

## Key Highlights

- Simple and fast prediction workflow  
- Easy-to-use symptom selection—no medical expertise required  
- Private and secure; minimal user information is stored  
- Option to use the application anonymously  
- Admin panel for managing datasets and retraining the ML model  
- Works smoothly on both mobile and desktop devices

## Frontend (React.js)

The frontend is built with React.js for a modern, clean, and responsive user interface.

### User Capabilities

- Create an account or log in  
- Choose symptoms from an interactive, searchable list  
- Receive real-time disease predictions  
- Admin users can upload patient data or retrain the ML model  
- Experience a fluid UI suitable for all device sizes  

### How the System Works

1. **User Authentication:**  
   After login, a token is generated and attached to outgoing API requests.

2. **Submitting Symptoms:**  
   Users select symptoms, which are sent to the backend in JSON format.

3. **Receiving Predictions:**  
   The backend processes the symptoms and returns the predicted disease.

4. **Admin Options:**  
   Admin accounts can initiate model training or upload CSV files for data handling.

### Running the Frontend Locally

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
